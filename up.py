"""the palette manager's rulings of 5 October: its workflows' actions at the versions built for Node 24, and a README whose test counts cannot go stale

For rnv-color-palette-manager, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (eb133b0).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

RULED 2026-10-05, items 14 and 18 of the list of 4 October:

  14  "Yes do it."
  18  "Do B."

ITEM 14. Both workflows used actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-python@v5
and actions/upload-artifact@v4. Each is built for Node 20, which GitHub
took off its runners on 2026-09-23; since then they are run on Node 24 with
a warning on every job. They move to the first versions built for Node 24:
checkout v5, setup-python v6, upload-artifact v6, the versions the brand
repository moved to on 2026-10-04. Each action's own action.yml was read at
both versions: every input these workflows pass is an input of the newer
one, with the same default.

ITEM 18. The README stated 745 tests; pytest collected 994. Every count is a
floor now: over 800 tests, over 300 in the root suite, over 400 under
tests/. A floor is the number of test functions the suite defines, rounded
down to the hundred, so the next test leaves it true. The two counts beside
the file tree are dropped.

THE GUARDS. tests/test_workflow_actions.py holds every action in every
workflow at its floor. tests/test_readme_test_counts.py holds every count in
the README to a floor, and every floor to the truth.

WHAT ONLY A RUN ON GITHUB SHOWS. That the workflows run with the newer
actions. The first run after this is committed is that test.

No file the application runs is touched.
